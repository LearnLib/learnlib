/**
 * Interface for a cache used in automata learning.
 * <p>
 * The idea of a cache is to save (potentially expensive) queries to the real system under learning by storing the
 * results of previous queries. This is particularly useful as many learning algorithms pose redundant queries, i.e.,
 * pose the same query twice or more times in different contexts.
 * <p>
 * A learning cache provides a {@link #createCacheConsistencyTest() cache consistency test}, which is an equivalence
 * query realization that only checks a given hypothesis against the contents of the cache.
 *
 * @param <A>
 *         the (maximally generic) automaton model for which the cache stores information. For example, for a {@link
 *         MealyMachine Mealy} cache this would be {@code MealyMachine<?,I,?,O>}. This type determines what the cache
 *         contents can be checked against by a {@link #createCacheConsistencyTest() cache consistency test}
 * @param <I>
 *         input symbol type
 * @param <O>
 *         output symbol type
