/**
 * This package provides the implementation of (a blue-fringe version of) the "regular positive negative inference"
 * (RPNI) learning algorithm as presented in the paper <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789812797902_0004">Inferring
 * regular languages in polynomial update time</a> by Jose Oncina and Pedro Garc√≠a, including merging heuristics such as
 * the "evidence-driven state merging" (EDSM) and "minimum description length" (MDL) strategies.
 * <p>
 * More details on these implementations can be found in the book <a
 * href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139194655">Grammatical Inference</a> by Colin de la Higuera.
