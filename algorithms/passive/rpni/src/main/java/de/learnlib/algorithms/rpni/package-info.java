/**
 * This package (and sub-packages) provides the implementation of (a blue-fringe version of) the "regular positive
 * negative inference" (RPNI) learning algorithm as presented in the paper <a
 * href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789812797902_0004">Inferring regular languages in polynomial update time</a> by
 * Jose Oncina and Pedro Garc√≠a.
 * <p>
 * More details on the blue-fringe version of this algorithm can be found in the book <a
 * href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139194655">Grammatical Inference</a> by Colin de la Higuera.
