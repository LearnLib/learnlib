/**
 * A query is the basic form of interaction between a {@link LearningAlgorithm learner} and a {@link MembershipOracle
 * (membership) oracle}, or teacher.
 * <p>
 * In LearnLib, queries are performed in a callback-like fashion: an oracle does not <i>return</i> the responses to the
 * queries, but rather invokes the {@link #answer(Object)} method on the query objects it was provided with. This allows
 * for implementing queries which directly react to an answered query (e.g., by modifying some internal data structure),
 * without the need for buffering answers. It also allows for a more efficient parallel processing of queries, as there
 * is no need for maintaining a common (synchronized) result data structure such as a map. However, this means that a
 * learner cannot rely on the {@link #answer(Object)} method of a query being called from the same thread which invoked
 * {@link MembershipOracle#processQueries(java.util.Collection)}. If this causes concurrency issues, a safe choice is to
 * use queries of class {@link DefaultQuery}, which simply store the response and make it accessible via {@link
 * DefaultQuery#getOutput()} for processing after the {@link MembershipOracle#processQueries(java.util.Collection)} call
 * returns, guaranteeing thread-safety.
 * <p>
 * Conceptually, a query is divided into a {@link #getPrefix() prefix} and a {@link #getSuffix()} suffix. The prefix
 * part of a query identifies a state in the (unknown) target system, whereas the suffix is the "experiment" which is
 * conducted on the system starting from the state to which it was transferred by the prefix. While the prefix
 * influences the response of the target system to a query, the answer is the <i>directly observable</i> reaction to
 * executing the suffix.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example 1:</b> when learning {@link MealyMachine Mealy machines}, the prefix transfers the target system to a
 * certain state. The outputs produced by the system while executing the prefix are <i>not</i> part of the answer, as
 * the role of the prefix is limited to reaching a certain state. The reaction of the target system consists of the
 * output word produced while executing the suffix. Therefore, in the setting of Mealy machine learning, a valid oracle
 * will call the {@link #answer(Object)} method with a word of the same length as the suffix.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example 2:</b> when learning {@link DFA}s, the reaction of the target system is fully determined by the state
 * reached by an input word. Since both prefix and suffix have the same effect on producing this output (by transferring
 * the system to a certain state), the response will always be a single {@link Boolean}, and, furthermore, for every
 * input word {@code w}, the response to a query will always be the same regardless of the subdivision of {@code w = uv}
 * into prefix {@code u} and suffix {@code v} (including the corner cases <code>u = &epsilon;</code> and <code>v =
 * &epsilon;</code>).
 *
 * @param <I>
 *         input symbol type
 * @param <D>
 *         output domain type
