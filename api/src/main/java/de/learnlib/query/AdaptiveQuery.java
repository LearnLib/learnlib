 * An adaptive query is a variation of the (regular) {@link Query} that allows one to dynamically select the symbols to
 * query based on responses to previous symbols.
 * <p>
 * After {@link #getInput() fetching} the current input symbol that should be evaluated on the system under learning,
 * its respective output must be {@link #processOutput(Object) processed} by the query object in order to determine the
 * next action to make. This essentially establishes a symbol-wise dialogue between the query object and the system
 * under learning and makes adaptive queries inherently stateful.
 * <p>
 * For the semantics of this conversation, see the different {@link Response} values and their respective
