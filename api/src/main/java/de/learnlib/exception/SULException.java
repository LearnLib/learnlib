/**
 * Unchecked exception class that can be used by implementors of a {@link SUL} to wrap any exceptions that occur during
 * the {@link SUL#step(Object)} methods.
 * <p>
 * <b>Rationale for being unchecked:</b> Implementors of a learning or equivalence checking algorithm that directly
 * operates on the SUL level usually have no sensible way of dealing with such an exception (comparable to when {@link
 * MembershipOracle#processQueries(java.util.Collection)} throws a runtime exception). However, it may be of interest to
 * some components, like for instance a mapper that maps exceptions to special output symbols.
 * <p>
 * <b>Caveat:</b> When implementing your {@link SUL#step(Object)} method, <b>never ever</b> catch exceptions with a
 * {@code catch(Throwable)} statement! This would also catch internal VM-related errors such as {@link
 * StackOverflowError} or {@link OutOfMemoryError}. Only ever catch {@link Exception} and any user-created subclasses of
 * {@link Throwable} that apply.
