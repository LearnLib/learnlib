/**
 * Suffix-based local counterexample analyzer.
 * <p>
 * Given a query {@code (u, v)} which is a counterexample (i.e., the suffix-output for {@code (u,v)} is distinct from
 * the target system's output for {@code (u,v)}), it calculates the index {@code i} of the suffix such that
 * {@code w[i:]} ({@code w = uv}) still allows to expose a behavioral difference for an adequate prefix. This adequate
 * prefix can be determined as {@code {w[:i]}}, where {@code {.}} denotes the access sequence of the corresponding
 * word.
 * <p>
 * The effect of adding such a suffix can be described as follows: {@code {w[:i]}} and {@code {w[:i-1]}w[i-1]} both
 * lead to the same state in the hypothesis, but a local suffix finder chooses the index i such that the output for
 * {@code ({w[:i]}, w[i:])} and {@code ({w[:i-1]}w[i-1], w[i:])} will differ. Hence, the transition to the state
 * reached by {@code {w[:i]}} from {@code {w[:i-1]}} is disproved.
 * <p>
 * Please note that the type parameters of these class only constitute <i>upper</i> bounds for the respective input
 * symbol and output classes, denoting the requirements of the process in general. A suffix finder which does not
 * exploit any properties of the used classes will implement this interface with {@code <Object,Object>} generic
 * arguments only. The genericity is still maintained due to the {@code RI} and {@code RO} generic parameters in the
 * {@link #findSuffixIndex(Query, AccessSequenceTransformer, SuffixOutput, MembershipOracle)} method.
 *
 * @param <I>
