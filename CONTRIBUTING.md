# How to contribute to LearnLib


### **Did you find a bug?**

* **If the bug is a security vulnerability** do not open up a GitHub issue but instead refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/LearnLib/learnlib/blob/develop/SECURITY.md).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/LearnLib/learnlib/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/LearnLib/learnlib/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Please provide as much relevant information as possible including a precise title.


### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, you can test locally whether the integration tests will (likely) pass. Simply enable the same Maven profiles as our [CI pipelines](https://github.com/LearnLib/learnlib/blob/develop/.github/workflows/ci.yml).


### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [discussions](https://github.com/LearnLib/learnlib/discussions/categories/ideas) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and confirmed feature requests.


### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any questions about how to use LearnLib in the [discussions](https://github.com/LearnLib/learnlib/discussions/categories/q-a).
